    "Price prediction is the process of using statistical or machine learning techniques to estimate the value of a property or product based on various factors such as location, size, and other relevant features. In the context of real estate, price prediction models can be used to estimate the market value of a property or to determine a competitive listing price. The accuracy of a price prediction model depends on the quality and quantity of the data used, as well as the sophistication of the algorithm employed.\n",
